        <h2>Everything About You</h2><br>
        <p>You are the only one who I wouldn't mind losing sleep for, the only one who I can never get tired of talking to and the only one who crosses my mind constantly throughout the day. You are the only one who can make me smile without any intention and affect my emotions with every action of yours. I can't explain in words how much you mean to me but you're the one I'm afraid of losing and the one I want to keep in my life, You complete me in every way. I thank God for blessing me with a wonderful being like you. Indeed you're my better half, and I appreciate your incredible presence in my life. I love you as high as I can reach, as far as I can see, to infinity and beyond. From this day to our final days. No words can express how much I love you.. I promise to love you forever and every single day of forever. semoga kita bisa main sesuka kita, kita bisa ketemu sesuka kita, kita ga jauh jauhan lagi, kita bisa ngelakuin banyak hal sesuka dan semau kita.. i hope one day, I'll wake up in the morning, I won't be alone, I won't text you or call you, I won't miss you or feel unsafe about you. Because one day, when I wake up in the morning, you'll be lying next to me and not miles awayü§ç‚ú®</p>
